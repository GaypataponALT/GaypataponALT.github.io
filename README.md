Kukadoom is a patapon inspired game where you play as hancho trying to save his parents from the stone curse, when megumiban saw hancho in dispair, she gave him three spear urabans, a flag, and four drums that are very important for commanding his fellow uraban units, everytime he's on a mission he finds more manjis that have been kidnapped by the nanja tribes. Maybe someday he will see his parents again?
